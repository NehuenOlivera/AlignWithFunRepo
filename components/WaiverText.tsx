          <strong>1. Acknowledgement of Risks</strong>
          <br />I understand that participating in movement, fitness,
          stretching, strengthening, balance, and/or wellness classes offered by
          Align With Fun involves physical activity that carries inherent risks.
          These risks may include, but are not limited to, muscle strain,
          injury, falls, faintness, or other health complications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I confirm that I am physically able to participate in these activities
          and have sought medical advice if needed. I accept full responsibility
          for my own safety and well-being during any class or session.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Health & Medical Conditions</strong>
          <br />I confirm that I have disclosed any relevant medical conditions,
          injuries, pregnancy, or other health concerns that may affect my
          participation. I agree to notify Align With Fun of any changes to my
          health prior to attending future classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pregnant clients must seek medical approval before attending classes
          and follow any guidance given by Align With Fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Personal Belongings</strong>
          <br />I acknowledge that all personal belongings brought to
          class—including phones, wallets, keys, bags, and other items—are my
          responsibility. Align With Fun is not responsible for any loss, theft,
          or damage to personal property before, during, or after class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Outdoor Participation</strong>
          <br />I understand that participating outdoors, or in spaces not
          directly controlled by Align With Fun may increase risk, and that I am
          responsible for ensuring a safe environment for myself. I accept full
          responsibility for my choice of participation location.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>5. Waiver of Liability</strong>
          <br />
          To the fullest extent permitted by Australian law, I release,
          indemnify, and hold harmless Align With Fun, its owner(s),
          instructors, employees, and contractors from any and all claims,
          actions, demands, or causes of action arising from participation in
          classes, sessions, or related activities. This includes claims for
          injury, illness, or property loss, whether caused by negligence,
          breach of contract, or otherwise. I understand that movement practices
          carry a risk of serious injury. I voluntarily choose to participate
          and assume all associated risks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Participant Responsibility</strong>
          <br />I agree to:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>
              Stop immediately if I experience pain, dizziness, faintness, or
              shortness of breath
            </li>
            <li>
              Seek medical advice before returning to class if any health
              concern arises
            </li>
            <li>Follow all class instructions and safety guidance</li>
            <li>Use equipment responsibly</li>
            <li>
              Take full responsibility for managing my own physical limitations
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>7. Cancelation Policies</strong>
          <br />
          We kindly ask that any cancellations be made at least 24 hours prior
          to your session. This helps us keep the space flowing and offer your
          spot to another guest.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>8. Policies & Conduct</strong>
          <br />I agree to respect class guidelines, arrival times, and any
          cancellation/no-show policies. I understand that disruptive or unsafe
          behaviour may result in removal from a class or future bookings.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>9. Severability</strong>
          <br />
          If any portion of this agreement is found to be invalid under
          applicable law, the remainder shall remain valid and enforceable.
        </p>
